Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems 
capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include 
learning from experience, recognizing patterns, solving problems, making decisions, and 
understanding natural language. AI systems use algorithms and data to simulate human -like 
cognitive abilities, allowing them to automate processes, enhance decision -making, and 
improve efficiency across various industries.  
AI is broad ly categorized into narrow AI (weak AI)  and general AI (strong AI) . Narrow AI is 
designed to perform specific tasks, such as virtual assistants (Alexa, Siri), recommendation 
systems (Netflix, Spotify), and fraud detection in banking. These systems are highly specialized 
but lack the ability to generalize knowledge beyond their intended purpose. In contrast, general 
AI refers to a theoretical form of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do, 
adapting and learning across various domai ns. While general AI remains a concept, 
advancements in deep learning and neural networks continue to push AI closer to human -like 
intelligence.  
AI technologies rely on key techniques such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural 
language processin g (NLP), and computer vision . Machine learning enables systems to learn 
from data without explicit programming, while deep learning, a subset of ML, uses neural 
networks to process complex information. NLP allows AI to understand and generate human 
languag e, powering chatbots and translation services. Computer vision enables AI to interpret 
images and videos, playing a crucial role in facial recognition, medical diagnostics, and 
autonomous vehicles.  
AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, finance,  education, and cybersecurity, 
improving efficiency and innovation. In healthcare, AI assists in disease diagnosis and drug 
discovery, while in finance, it detects fraudulent transactions and optimizes trading strategies. 
However, AI also presents challeng es, including ethical concerns, job displacement, bias in AI 
models, and security risks . As AI continues to evolve, responsible development, regulation, and 
ethical considerations are essential to ensure its positive impact on society.
